### `Don't Catastrophize 😳`

A lot of procrastination is triggered by catastrophizing (or making a big deal out of) a certain task or assignment. It might be due to the task being boring, difficult, or unpleasant to complete 😞

But, usually, the underlying feeling is that the task/assignment is just downright **unbearable.**

Let's not forget that procrastination *is linked to stress.* So, to deal with that stress, **try to keep things in perspective!** *Yes, this isn't what I want to be doing right now, BUT I* ***know*** *I can get through this and complete this!* `A positive mindset` can do WONDERS -- I promise you!

---

### `Remember your 'Why' 🤗`

Instead of dreading starting a certain task/assignment, try focusing on `the why`: why are you having to complete this? Is it for your degree? Or possibly for a certificate? Or a coding course?

Whatever it may be, `try to focus on the benefits of completing it!!`

### `Time to get a Planner!! 😆`

Projects/tasks that get done *"when you have time”* (as in *“I'll just do it when I have time”*) usually don't get done very often, if ever.

Repeat after me: **time management is my best friend!**

If you don't already have one, it's time to get a planner or a calendar!! **It's essential** to schedule when you are going to work on a project/assignment and block out that time 😎😎

And *when it is time* to do your work, **put away all distractions (phone, social media, etc.) and set a timer** so you can be focused for the entire time you've set aside

---

### `Be Honest with yourself 💕`

What I mean is, if you're not a morning person, you *probably* won't be taking an 8 am college class, will you? 😅

Being realistic with yourself **sets you up for success**. Some projects/assignments can take longer than expected, so maybe factor in some extra time.

And look for ways to make it easier on yourself: like I mentioned above, if you're not a morning person, don’t expect yourself to get up at 5 am to start coding that app you've been designing for weeks... it might be better to schedule that project during lunch or before dinner

---

### `Chunks FTW 😎`

Procrastination happens often when you have an assignment/project or task that just seems SO overwhelming 😅

So, ask yourself this: `"How can I break this project/task into smaller, more manageable chunks?" 🤔`

Breaking things into chunks and organizing those chunks in your calendar/planner goes \* a very long way!\* You'll notice you no longer dread completing that task/project 🥳

An example: you have a ten-page research paper due in a month. But, where do you begin? *How do you get started?*

1. Organize your necessary to-dos into chunks! From the example above, a chunk would be 'finding a topic', or 'collecting credible sources'
    
2. Then, designate a chunk to complete each day over the next few months/weeks! (In this essay example, you'd plan to 'find a topic' on Monday, and 'find credible resources' on Tuesday, *then* 'start your rough draft' on Wednesday!)

**Separating an overbearing task/project into chunks, and organizing those in your planner will leave you feeling more empowered and less overwhelmed**. I promise!! 🥰

### `Excuses be Gone 🤘🏼`

Have you found yourself saying:

* *"I'll get around to it when I have time"*
    
* *"I need X and Y to happen before I can get started"*, or
    
* *"I just have to be in the mood to complete this".*
    

Those are **EXCUSES!** It's time to [`Be honest with yourself`](#honest) and just START!

---

### `Zero Distractions 😡😡`

The environment/space you work in can either *hinder your productivity* OR *help it*. So, look around the room you're currently working in...what in it can you credit to being a distraction?

Check your computer/laptop...do you have tons of social media tabs open? How about Slack or Discord? 🤨

During this scheduled block of time to work on a task/project, here are a few things you should do:

* close your email and IM
    
* turn off your phone (or at least set it on “Do Not Disturb” and put it out of sight)
    
* don’t let yourself get on the internet until you have completed the task/try to hold off any necessary internet searches until the end

### `Give yourself some Credit!! 👏🏼`

Give yourself a reward if—**and only if**—you complete what you set out to do!! 🥳🥳

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9Q249Qsl5cfLi" width="280" height="210" class="giphy-embed"></iframe>

Don't let yourself binge-watch that new Netflix show, check Twitter, or go out for a lunch date until you complete the task you have planned!

Instead of using those activities to procrastinate, make them contingent upon **you actually finishing** what you schedule yourself to do 😎😎
