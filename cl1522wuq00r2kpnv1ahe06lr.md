Howdy! I've taken a tiny hiatus blogging due to my classes this semester - *but, I have returned!* ü§©

And I have returned with...
*drumroll*
 ... a golden list of resources to use if you're learning SQL **or** hoping to get started with SQL! (*Click the title of each website to visit it).*

If you need a quick overview of SQL, [watch this 8 minute video by Socratica!](https://youtu.be/OfM5lC-7R4Y)

### [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) 

W3Schools is one of the best websites to study *almost any language or framework*, but it's especially handy for SQL! It not only goes over every concept in SQL with intense detail, but it also has a section to 'Try out' whatever you're currently learning in a terminal.

And once you've completed the 'Try it yourself' exercises the lesson has to offer, there is even a Quiz in each lesson to test your knowledge!

### [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)

SQL Bolt is one of my favorite resources for diving into the Basics of SQL *fast!* I've completed all the lessons SQL Bolt has to offer, and I can honestly say it helped me with the syntax of SQL so much. 

Below is a list of interactive lessons ready to be completed:

You'll be writing queries in SQL in no time with this resource! üòé

### [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn)

DataCamp is a website solely meant to study anything related to Data! Some of their course include 'Intro to Tableau', 'Data Science for Everyone', and 'Intro to SQL'. 

What I love most about DataCamp, is there are 'Career Tracks' and 'Skill Tracks' available for us to follow.  Currently, their only Career Track involving SQL is the 'Data Analyst' track plan, but the courses involved in that Career Track are extremely helpful!

Sign up for a free account to access the Data Analyst Career Track using SQL: [sign up here](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-sql-server?version=2).

As for Skill Tracks, DataCamp makes it super easy to pick a language and get started, see below.

Their current SQL courses are: 
- SQL Fundamentals
- SQL Server Fundamentals
- SQL for Business Analysts 
- SQL Server for Database Administrators 
- SQL for Database Administrators

Each lesson contains interactive tutorials with a real terminal! You'll fill in the blanks to complete the queries, then run the query to make sure it's correct. Take a look below.

I've completed a good portion of the Data Analyst track, about 30-40%, and I have to say... it's helped me a lot. ü§©

### [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/)

Select Star SQL is similar to our other interactive tutorial resources, but with a twist: it helps you learn SQL by running queries **against a real-world dataset to complete projects of consequence.** 

As a data nerd, this is *reeeeeeally* cool.

Interactive portions of the lessons will look like this:

Each chapter should take about 30 minutes, ü•∞ and there are 4 chapters.
