## How to Make a Bash Script Executable in Linux

Hey coders! üß°

I completed my Linux Operating System course this semester *(with an A!!!!)* ü•≥, and wanted to blog about a few fun things I've learned in the class!

Let's talk about how you can make a Bash script executable ü§†

_______

<h3>Step 1: Create a new text file</h3>

First, we have to create a file to write our script in. I use the Vim editor mainly, so I'll be demonstrating the example within Vim! 

To create a new file in Vim, type: `vi MyNewScript.sh` in the command line, like below

<h3>Step 2: Add #!/bin/bash </h3>

Don't forget to add your *sha-bang* to the top of your Vim (or Nano) file! This is key for 'making it executable'.

<h3>Step 3: Add your script! </h3>

This is where the fun begins ü§† you can easily automate simple processes in a function *within* your Bash script! Here's an example ‚§µÔ∏è

In the above script example, I created a function, `CreateDir()`. When called, `CreateDir` should accept a new directory name as a command-line argument and then create a new directory (if you don't already have a directory created with the same name!) 

___________

<h3>Step 4: At the command line, run chmod u+x </h3>

Wondering what `chmod u+x` does? 
It grants only the owner of that file execution permissions. (Basically making it only executable for the owner of the file.)

<h3>Step 5: Run your script! </h3>

To run your new script, simply type `./YourScriptFileName.sh`! (The key is using `./` in front of your script file.)

As you can see above, the script successfully catches a duplicate directory name, and won't allow it to be created. ü§† yeehaw!

and voila!! That is the simple process of making a script executable in Linux ü•∞

Stay tuned for more articles on Vim in Linux, cronjobs, etc.! I have some fun Linux content planned üß°
